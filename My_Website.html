    <h3><u>What is Html?</u></h3>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard language used to create and structure web pages, defining the content, layout, and elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links that are displayed in a web browser. It uses a system of "tags" enclosed in angle brackets to mark up content and organize it into semantic elements, which tells the browser how to render the content on the screen.</p>
    <h3><u>What HTML does:</u></h3>
      <h4>Structures content:</h4>
       <p>HTML provides the basic building blocks for a webpage, allowing you to add headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, and more. </p>
       <h4>Adds semantics:</h4>
       HTML elements give meaning to content, such as identifying a particular piece of text as a paragraph (p) or a heading H1. <br><br><br><br>
